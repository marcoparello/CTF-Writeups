I downloaded `chal.jpg` onto my computer, and opened it with my computer's image viewer:

With any location-based OSINT challenge, I like to use `GeoSpy.ai`. It's a great way to get an idea of where to look. So, I inputted `chal.jpg` into GeoSpy.ai:

I then searched `Prudential Tower`, found the coordinates, and then went onto Google Street View:

Using the challenge description, I then submitted `uiuctf{Arlington Street, Boston}` and solved the challenge.
