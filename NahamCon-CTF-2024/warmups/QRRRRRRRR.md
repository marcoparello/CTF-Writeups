That is a long QR code. I first tried scanning it with the QR code scanner on my phone, but since this wasn't a normal QR code, I wasn't able to scan it. So, I did some research on the internet about the types of QR codes. After some time, I found that this was an iQR code (basically the successor to the QR code). Now that I knew which type of QR code it was, I pivoted to researching how to scan the iQR code. Eventually, I found the article `Rectangular Micro QR Code (rMQR)` from the website `Hackaday.io`. The article mentioned the QRQR app, so I downloaded the app on my phone, displayed the iQR code on my desktop in full glory, and then scanned it with the app, revealing the flag to be:

`flag{a44557e380e3baae9c21c738664c6142}`

I then submitted the flag and solved the challenge.
