That is a long QR code. Longest I've ever seen. So I did some research on the interent about the types of qr codes on the interent, I found that this was an iQR code (basically the successor to the QR code). Now that I knew which type of QR code it was, I pivioted to resarching how to scan the iQR code , I found `Rectangular Micro QR Code (rMQR)` from the website `Hackaday.io`, which mentioned the QRQR app. I downloaded the app on my phone, displayed the iQR code on my desktop in full glory, and then scanned it with the app, revealing the flag to be:

`flag{a44557e380e3baae9c21c738664c6142}`

I then submitted the flag and solved the challenge.
