# Luggage Lock
To solve this challenge, go to the video in the hint. During the video Chris Elgee will mention how by lining up the notches of the lock, the lock will open. If that doesnâ€™t work, simply turn each notch to the right and try again. Repeat the process until the lock is unlocked. However, if the notches having a sliding lock, simply put some pressure on the button and slide the numbers until they stop sliding. Using this method I was able to digitally crack all of the locks.
