# Bonus! Fishing Mastery
Like in Pokemon, I now gotta catch them all (Nintendo please don't sue me)! Since there are 171 fish, it wouldn't be efficient for me to manually click the "cast" button and wait for "reel it in" button to turn red (indicating that a fish took the bait). Additonally, while fishing, the game is programmed to give duplicate catches. Therefore having to manually fish all 171 fish would take "only" 171 tries in the **best case** scenario. So, I went to my friend ChatGPT and gave them this prompt:

(I prompted ChatGPT to give a summary of all of my prompts, as it took around an hour of trial and error to actually get a working script). 

After "raging against the machine" for around an hour, I finally got a working script.
