# Snowball Fight
In order to beat this challenge, you simply have to defeat Santa in a snowball fight with another player. No challenge here, simply play the game and win. Luckily, since I had around 350 hours in Monster Hunter World, I was very good at dodging the snowballs thrown by Santa. It was hard to take him down, but eventually, I was able to accomplish the task with another player. Turns out "git gud" is actually pretty good advice.
