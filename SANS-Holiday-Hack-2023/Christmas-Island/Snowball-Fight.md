# Snowball Fight
In order to beat this challenge you simply have to defeat Santa in a snowball fight with another player. No challenge here, simply play the game and win. Luckily, since I had around 350 hours in Monster Hunter World, I was very good at dodging the snowballs thrown by Santa. It was hard to take him down, but eventually I was able to accomplish the task with another player. Turns out "git gud" is actually pretty good advice. 

Of course, since the game was hosted on the client side, there were a lot of fun "tricks" that I could've done.
