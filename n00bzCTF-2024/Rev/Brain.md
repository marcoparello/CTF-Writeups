# Brain

![](../images/brain-part-1.png)

I clicked on `bf.txt`, which took me to a webpage that displayed:
```txt
>+++++++++++[<++++++++++>-]<[-]>++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-]>++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-]>++++++++++++++[<+++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[<+++>-]<[-]>+++++++[<+++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++[<+++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++[<++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++[<++++++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++[<+++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<[-]>++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-]>++++++++++[<++++++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++[<+++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++[<+++++>-]<[-]>+++++++[<+++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++[<++++++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++[<+++++>-]<[-]>++++++++++++++[<+++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++[<++++>-]<[-]>+++++++[<+++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++[<++++++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++[<++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[<+>-]<[-]>+++++++++++[<+++>-]<[-]>+++++++++++++++++++++++++[<+++++>-]<[-]
```

Since the challenge was called Brain and the file is named `bf.txt`, I could reasonably conclude that the langauge in `bf.txt` is the brainfuck coding langauge (I am not making this up that is what the actual title of the langauge is called. It's a "joke" coding langugae, not meant to ever be used seriously. It's more like "look at this crazy langauge I made").

So, I used `kvbc.github.io/bf-ide/` brainfuck IDE, which allows me to set breakpoints. I also used the "beautify" feature to make the code more readable, which resulted in:

```txt

```

I noticed that the code regularly repeated the `<` character, which was interesting. So, I set breakpoints at each `<`:

```txt
>+++++++++++
[<++++++++++>-]

```

I then ran the code in the IDE, and checked the memory map after each breakpoint:


1st `<`:

```txt
n
```

2nd `<`:
```txt
0
```
3rd `<`:
```txt
0
```
4th `<`:
```txt
b
```
5th `<`:
```txt
z
```
6th `<`:
```txt
{
```
`n00bz{` is the standard flag format for this competition. Additionally, after each breakpoint, the code clears the memory. I continue going through each breakpoint:

7th `<`:
```txt
1
```
8th `<`:
```txt
_
```
9th `<`:
```txt
c
```
10th `<`:
```txt
4
```
11th `<`:
n
12th `<`:
_
13th `<`:
c
14th `<`:
0
15th `<`:
d
16th `<`:
3
17th `<`:
_
18th `<`:
1
19th `<`:
n
20th `<`:
_
21st `<`:
b
22nd `<`:
r
23rd `<`:
4
24th `<`:
1
25th `<`:
n
26th `<`:
f
27th `<`:
*
28th `<`:
c
29th `<`:
k
30th `<`:
!
31st `<`:
}

Now to bring it all together:
n00bz{1_c4n_c0d3_1n_br41nf*ck!}
