# Brain

![](../images/brain-part-1.png)

I clicked on `bf.txt`, which took me to a webpage that displayed:
```txt

Since the challenge was called Brain and the file is named `bf.txt`, I could reasonably conclude that the langauge in `bf.txt` is the brainfuck coding langauge (I am not making this up that is what the actual title of the langauge is called. It's a "joke" coding langugae, not meant to ever be used seriously. It's more like "look at this crazy langauge I made").

So, I used `kvbc.github.io/bf-ide/` brainfuck IDE, which allows me to set breakpoints. I also used the "beautify" feature to make the code more readable, which resulted in:

I noticed that the code regularly repeated the `<` character, And step through the code manually step by step. I notice that there are characters. Maybe if I set a breakpoint after each `<`, it will reveal each character of the flag?

1st `<`:

n

2nd `<`:
0
3rd `<`:
0
4th `<`:
b
5th `<`:
z
6th `<`:
{
7th `<`:
1
8th `<`:
_
9th `<`:
c
10th `<`:
4
11th `<`:

12th `<`:

13th `<`:

14th `<`:
0
15th `<`:
d
16th `<`:

17th `<`:

18th `<`:

20th `<`:

21st `<`:

f
27th `<`:

k
30th `<`:

31st `<`:

Now to bring it all together:

Here is the code with the breakpoints:
