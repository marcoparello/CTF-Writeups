# SAM I AM

![](../images/sam-i-am-part-1.png)

I downloaded `samiam.zip` and placed it on my Kali Linux VM. From there, I unzipped it, which revealed that `samiam.zip` contained 2 files: sam.bak and system.bak. Junior Crypt 2024 had a lot of SAM file challenges, so I knew what I had to do. So I typed:

```txt
samdump2 system.bak sam.balk
```
